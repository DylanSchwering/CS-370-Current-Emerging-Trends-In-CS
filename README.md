Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
This project is a path finding Deep-Q learning agent. The code that was provided to me was the creation of the maze that the pathfinding bot is to learn to naviagate, the movement, and the gameplay loop. The code that I created was the Deep-Q learning algorthim to solve the maze.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists in general solve problems using computers and computer programming. More specifically they design algorithoms to solve problems, study computing theory, and work with data. As the world becomes more connected to the internet computer scientists only grow more important to solve the problems that will arrise.
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
To approach a problem as a computer scientist you first start by truly understanding the problem, break it down into smaller, more understandable pieces, design an algorithm that can tackle the problem, make your solution (write your code), and then test and debug your solution.
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilites to the end user are to provide the appropreate levels of privacy and security for the user and the user's data. My responsibilities to the organization are to follow security practicecs, work efficiently, and have integrity with my work.
